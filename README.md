# UBUNTU INSTALLER AUTOMATION
Created with :blue_heart: by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anh-nguyen2/">Anh</a>  

A small script to speed up the ubuntu installation or any OS that will be installed along side with the current OS. The detailed explanation for this repository could be found <a href="https://escapingpill.wordpress.com/2020/03/19/install-ubuntu-linux-without-usb/#toc">here</a>  

# Architecture
Main script to be executed is *ubuntu-installer-automation.bat*
Other scripts have to be put under the same directory with the main script

# Improvements needed
* export the information of total volumn of SDD in the pre-installation examination
* export the information of graphic display (important for other OS for instance: <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS</a> )
* Convert Manual steps in Pre-installation into Automation Flow (Download Linux Distro, Download Boot manager for Window)
* Add more conditions for disk checkup before partitioning
